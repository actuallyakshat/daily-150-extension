    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 4th March 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Thank you for using the Daily-150 Chrome Extension. Your privacy is
      important to us, and this policy explains how we handle your data.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      This extension does not collect, store, or share any personal data. It
      only accesses your browsing activity to check if you have completed a
      journal entry before allowing access to social media websites.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      The extension requires access to Chrome storage to save your journaling
      status and block social media websites until an entry is made.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share data with third parties. However, if you log into our
      journaling platform (<a href="https://daily150.actuallyakshat.in"
        >Daily-150</a
      >), that website may have its own privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy occasionally. Any significant changes will be
      communicated through the extension or our website.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
